\section{Design decisions}

\subsection{Database}
We use MongoDB for our database. We chose to use this database as it is easy to implement and easy to use. We have
a MongoDB database with 1 collection, Bikes. The Bikes collection stores all bike locations and their availability. There should be a second database collection, Users, for storing the name, passwords and a list of rented bikes. Due to lack of time, we weren't able to implement this correctly.
