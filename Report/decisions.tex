\section{Design decisions}

\subsection{Database}
We use MongoDB for our database. We chose to use this database as it is easy to implement and easy to use. We have
a MongoDB database with 1 collection, Bikes. The Bikes collection stores all bike locations and their availability. There should be a second database collection, Users, for storing the name, passwords and a list of rented bikes. Due to lack of time, we weren't able to implement this correctly.

Why Play Framework with Scala

\subsection{Client}
Angular is a framework for building Web single-page applications. This is the main reason why we chose this framework. Other advantage of using Angular is its highly readable and comprehensive code. It was an important factor too, because we wanted something that will take as little time to learn as possible. We created the project using Angular Cli and used components to create the navigation bar, map component, and two (login and registration) forms (unfortunately not seen in the final layout). Even if it is not linked to framework itself, we found useful the large community of developers using Angular as online answers helped us solve most encountered problems.
