\section{Introduction}

In this project we developed a single page web application "Uber for bikes". The application should enable the Uber functionality for bikes. 

The application represents a map on which the positions of bikes are shown. These bikes are used by people
for transportation. The users can also see the table with the address information about the bikes. This coordinates of the bikes are streamed from the database and then transformed into addresses using the Google Maps API. The user can book a bike by pressing the corresponding button. When a bike is taken, its corresponding point on the map disappears (because it is no longer available). When the trip is finished the bike appears back on the map.
