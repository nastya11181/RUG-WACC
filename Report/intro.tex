\section{Introduction}

The application will represent a map on which positions of bikes will be shown. These bikes are used by people
for transportation. When a bike is taken, itâ€™s corresponding point on the map disappears (because it is no longer available). When the trip is finished the bike appears back on the map. For every bike, there will be a usage history available.
