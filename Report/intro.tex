\section{Introduction}

In this project we developed a single page web application "Uber for bikes". The final goal was to create something similar to the Uber functionality for bikes.

The application represents a map on which the positions of the bikes are shown. These bikes are used by people
for transportation. Users can also see the table with the address information about the bikes. The coordinates of the bikes are streamed from the database and then transformed into addresses using Google Maps API. The user can book a bike by pressing the corresponding button. When a bike is taken, its corresponding point on the map disappears (because it is no longer available) for all users except the user who reserved it. For that user the marker's position will be updated every 10 seconds in order to help the user reach the destination point easier. When the trip is finished the bike appears back on the map.
