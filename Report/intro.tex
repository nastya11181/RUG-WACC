\section{Introduction}

The application will represent a map on which the positions of bikes will be shown. These bikes are used by people
for transportation. Apart from the map, there is a table with the information about the bikes (the address). When a bike is taken, its corresponding point on the map disappears (because it is no longer available). When the trip is finished the bike appears back on the map.
