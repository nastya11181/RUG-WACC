\section{Introduction}

The application will represent a map on which positions of bikes will be shown. These bikes are used by people
for transportation. The initial implementation idea was the following: when a bike is taken, itâ€™s corresponding point on the map disappears (because it is no longer available). Bike's marker on the map would be visible only to the user who reserved the bike and the position would be updated every 10 seconds to help user arrive at the final destination easier. The second implementation plan consisted of the following: all the bikes will be shown on the map, however only the available ones will be shown in the table nearby. The distinction between a free bicycle and a selected one would be the color and/or the shape of the marker on the map. When the trip is finished the bike appears back on the map as before. For every bike, there will be a usage history available.
